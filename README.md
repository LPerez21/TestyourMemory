# **TestyourMind**
## Motivation to Build Game
We chose to build this game to improve and test our skill development as programmers. By customizing the game with a Peanuts theme, we were able to showcase our creative expression. Additionally, the game serves as an excellent teaching tool for children, helping them develop cognitive skills as they grow. And, of course, it's designed for pure enjoyment and fun!
## Description
Test Your Mind is a fun and engaging game that allows you to stimulate your brain and improve your cognitive skills. The goal is to match peanut-themed cards as quickly as possible, all while being timed to test how fast you can recall information. Once you begin the game, you will hear the iconic Peanuts theme song, providing some motivation to help you match the cards even faster!
## Technologies Used
* Javascript
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* W3Schools
* Powerpoint

These technologies were chosen because we wanted to put the knowledge we've learned so far to the test and showcase our potential as future coders. This game is also fully responsive and can be played on any screen, perfectly adapting to the device's size.
## Challenges Faced
While developing the game, we encountered several challenges, including:
* Adding background music (the Peanuts theme song).
* Storing game times in **local storage** to track player performance.
* Setting up a **timer** to track the time it tsakes to complete the game.
## Future Enhancements
We have some exciting plans for future updates, which include:
* Adding **player profiles**
* Implementing a **scoring system**
* Introducing **difficulty levels**
* Changing the timer to count down instead of up, to futher increase the challenge
* Screen adaptation improvement
